## Backtracking

This folder contains classic backtracking problems implemented in Java.  
Backtracking is a refined brute-force approach where we build the solution step by step  
and backtrack when we reach an invalid state.

### üìÇ Files & Paths

- [SubsetsBacktracking.java](SubsetsBacktracking.java)  
  **Description:**  
  Generates all possible subsets of a given set or array using backtracking.  
  This demonstrates how backtracking can explore all inclusion/exclusion possibilities.  

  **Key Points:**  
  - Uses recursion + backtracking to generate subsets.  
  - Similar to the power set problem.  
  - Handles duplicate avoidance when needed.  

  **Time Complexity:**  
  - `O(2^n)` subsets generated for `n` elements.  
  - Each subset takes `O(n)` to copy/print.

- [nQueens.java](nQueens.java)  
  **Description:**  
  Solves the classic N-Queens problem using backtracking.  
  Places N queens on an `N √ó N` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.  

  **Key Points:**  
  - Uses recursion to try placing queens row by row.  
  - Checks column and diagonal constraints at each step.  
  - Backtracks if placement is not valid.  

  **Time Complexity:**  
  - Worst case roughly `O(N!)` due to exploring all permutations of queen placement.  
  - Optimized with pruning for diagonals and columns.

### üìù About Backtracking  

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds candidates for solutions  
and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines the candidate cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.  
It‚Äôs especially useful for generating combinations, permutations, and solving constraint satisfaction problems  
such as Sudoku, N-Queens, and word searches.
