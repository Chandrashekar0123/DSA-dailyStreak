# Java Pattern Collection - Theory

This section explains the commonly used Java patterns in detail.  
Each heading links to the corresponding Java file implementation.

---

### 1. [Solid Rectangle](Patterns/SolidRectangle.java)
**Theory:** A solid rectangle pattern consists of rows and columns completely filled with stars (`*`). The number of rows and columns is fixed, and each cell in the rectangle is filled with a character. It is one of the simplest patterns used to understand nested loops.

---

### 2. [Hollow Rectangle](Patterns/HollowRectangle.java)
**Theory:** A hollow rectangle is similar to the solid rectangle, but only the boundary cells are filled with stars, while the inner cells are left blank (spaces). This pattern introduces the concept of conditional statements within nested loops.

### 3. [Half Pyramid](Patterns/HalfPyramid.java)
**Theory:** The half pyramid is a left-aligned triangle where the number of elements increases with each row. It is often used to understand nested loops and incremental logic.

---

### 4. [Invered Half Pyramid](Patterns/InveredHalfPyramid.java)
**Theory:** The inverted half pyramid is a left-aligned triangle where the number of elements decreases with each row. It is the reverse of the half pyramid and demonstrates decremental loops.

---

### 5. [Inverted Half Pyramid2](Patterns/InvertedHalfPyramid2.java)
**Theory:** This variation of the inverted half pyramid is right-aligned. Leading spaces are added to shift the stars to the right, helping learners understand the use of spaces in pattern alignment.

---

### 6. [Half Pyramid With Numbers](Patterns/HalfPyramidWithNumbers.java)
**Theory:** Instead of stars, numbers are printed in each row starting from 1. Each row contains consecutive numbers increasing in length. This helps understand numeric patterns and loop counters.

---

### 7. [Inverted Half Pyramid with Numbers](Patterns/InvertedHalfPyramidwithNumbers.java)
**Theory:** A numeric variant of the inverted half pyramid where numbers decrease in each row. It combines the logic of numeric sequences with decrementing loops.

---

### 8. [Floyd's Triangle](Patterns/FloydsTriangle.java)
**Theory:** Floyd's Triangle is a right-angled triangle of consecutive numbers starting from 1. Each row contains as many numbers as its row index, demonstrating sequential counting in nested loops.

---

### 9. [0-1 Triangle](Patterns/0-1Triangle.java)
**Theory:** A triangle pattern consisting of 0s and 1s, often alternating based on the row index or column index. This introduces conditional logic in pattern creation.

---

### 10. [Butterfly Pattern](Patterns/Butterfly.java)
**Theory:** A butterfly pattern consists of stars forming a mirrored shape along both vertical and horizontal axes, resembling butterfly wings. It demonstrates symmetry using nested loops.

---

### 11. [Solid Rhombus](Patterns/SolidRhombus.java)
**Theory:** A rhombus pattern is a diamond-shaped figure aligned in a grid. A solid rhombus fills all cells with stars and uses spaces for alignment, demonstrating space manipulation.

---

### 12. [Number Pyramid](Patterns/NumberPyramid.java)
**Theory:** A pyramid where numbers increase or repeat in each row to form a centered triangle. It combines centering logic with numeric sequencing.

---

### 13. [Palindromic Pattern](Patterns/PalindromicPattern.java)
**Theory:** A palindromic pattern prints numbers in a row that decrease to 1 and then increase back, forming a mirrored numeric sequence. It helps practice nested loops and symmetry logic.

---

### 14. [Diomand Pattern](Patterns/DiomandPattern.java)
**Theory:** The diamond pattern is a symmetric pattern of stars that increases to a maximum width and then decreases, forming a diamond shape. It introduces the concept of combining top and bottom halves with proper spacing.
