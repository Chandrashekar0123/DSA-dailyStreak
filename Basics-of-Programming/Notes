ðŸ“˜ Fundamentals of Programming â€“ (Java vs Python)
1. Program

A program is a set of instructions written to perform a specific task.

It tells the computer what to do step by step.

Java â†’ Needs to be written inside a class and compiled first, then run using JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

Python â†’ Can be written directly in a file or interpreter, no compilation needed (interpreted language).

ðŸ”¹ Key Difference:
Java is compiled + run, while Python is directly executed.

2. Source Code

The instructions written by the programmer in a programming language are called source code.

It is human-readable and stored in files (like .py,.java).

Java â†’ Written in .java files. After compilation, .class files are generated.

Python â†’ Written in .py files. Code runs directly using Python interpreter.

3. Compiler & Interpreter

Compiler: Translates the whole program into machine code at once. Faster execution but takes time to compile (used in C, C++, Java).

Interpreter: Translates and executes the program line by line. Easier for beginners but slower (used in Python, JavaScript).

Java â†’ Uses both. Code is compiled into bytecode (.class) and then executed by the JVM.

Python â†’ Purely interpreted, executed line by line by the Python interpreter.

4. Variables

A variable is a name given to a memory location where data is stored.

The value of a variable can change during the execution of the program.

Example: storing a studentâ€™s name, age, or marks in variables

Java â†’ Strongly typed. You must declare variable type before using it.

Example: int age = 20;

Python â†’ Dynamically typed. You just assign a value; type is decided automatically.

Example: age = 20

ðŸ”¹ Key Difference:
Java needs type declaration, Python does not.

5. Data Types

Java (primitive + objects):

byte, short, int, float, double, char, boolean, String (object).

Python (everything is object):

int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict.

6. Input and Output

Java â†’

Input â†’ Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

Output â†’ System.out.println("Hello");

Python â†’

Input â†’ input("Enter: ")

Output â†’ print("Hello")

7. Keywords

Java â†’ ~50 reserved words like int, class, public, static, void.

Python â†’ ~35 reserved words like def, class, if, else, import.

8. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on conditions.

Types:

If Statement â†’ Executes a block of code only if a condition is true.

If-Else Statement â†’ Executes one block if the condition is true, another if it is false.

If-Else If Ladder â†’ Used when multiple conditions must be checked one after another.

Java â†’ Needs parentheses and braces {}.

9. Switch Statement

A switch statement is used when a variable needs to be compared with many possible values.

Instead of writing multiple if-else statements, switch provides a cleaner structure.

Example in real life:

If day = 1 â†’ Monday

If day = 2 â†’ Tuesday

Else â†’ Other day

Java â†’ Has switch keyword. Used widely.

switch(day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Other");
}


Python â†’ No direct switch, but match-case introduced in Python 3.10.

match day:
    case 1: print("Monday")
    case 2: print("Tuesday")
    case _: print("Other")
