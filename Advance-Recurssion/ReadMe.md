# Advance Recursion 

This folder contains Java implementations of classic **Advance Recursion**  problems.  
Each file focuses on a specific concept to help understand how recursion works and how problems can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

## üìù Introduction to Recursion  

Recursion is a **programming technique** where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a larger problem.  
It is especially useful in problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems such as permutations, subsets, and backtracking algorithms.

### üîπ Advantages  
- Simplifies complex problems  
- Natural fit for divide-and-conquer algorithms  
- Reduces code complexity for certain tasks  

### üîπ Disadvantages  
- Uses more memory (stack calls)  
- Can lead to stack overflow if not handled properly

- **[InviteGuest.java](InviteGuest.java)**  
  Finds all possible ways to invite guests (single or in pairs) using recursion.

- **[SubsetofNaturalno.java](SubsetofNaturalno.java)**  
  Prints all possible subsets of the first `n` natural numbers using recursion/backtracking.

- **[ReadMe.md](ReadMe.md)**  
  This file ‚Äì overview and documentation of the recursion programs.
