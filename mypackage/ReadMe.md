## Java OOPS

This Folder contains key Java programming concepts including **Packages, Access Modifiers, and Methods**. The following notes summarize the **importance, applications, and core ideas** behind each concept.

## 1. Packages

### Package Creation
- **Definition:** A package is a **namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces**.
- **Purpose:**
  - Prevents **naming conflicts** between classes.
  - Makes **code modular and reusable**.
  - Enhances **maintainability** in large projects.
- **Applications:**
  - Organizing large software projects into **modules**.
  - Providing **library functionalities** (e.g., `java.util`, `java.io`).

### Package Usage
- **Definition:** Using a package involves importing classes/interfaces from a package to use in other programs.
- **Importance:**
  - Promotes **code reusability**.
  - Simplifies **project structure** and improves readability.
  - Allows **controlled access** to classes across packages.
- **Applications:**
  - Building **modular applications**.
  - Creating **custom libraries** for shared functionality.

## 2. Access Modifiers

### Test Access Modifiers
- **Definition:** Access modifiers control the **visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables**.
- **Types:**
  - **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.
  - **Private:** Accessible only within the class.
  - **Protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
  - **Default (Package-private):** Accessible within the same package only.
- **Importance:**
  - Provides **data encapsulation and security**.
  - Helps in **preventing accidental modification** of class members.
- **Applications:**
  - Protecting **sensitive data** in classes.
  - Designing **robust APIs**.
  - Maintaining **clean and secure codebases**.

## 3. Methods

### Static Methods
- **Definition:** Methods declared with `static` keyword belong to the **class, not objects**.
- **Importance:**
  - Can be called **without creating an object**.
  - Useful for **utility or helper methods**.
  - Saves memory since static methods **do not require instance creation**.
- **Applications:**
  - Math utilities (e.g., `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.random()`).
  - Logging, configuration, or global helper functions.

### Non-Static Methods
- **Definition:** Methods that belong to **instances (objects)** of a class.
- **Importance:**
  - Can access **instance variables** and manipulate object-specific data.
  - Fundamental for **object-oriented programming and encapsulation**.
- **Applications:**
  - Business logic tied to **specific objects**.
  - Dynamic behavior of classes in **real-world applications**.
